                        Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and
                        computer scientist who is widely considered to be the
                        father of computer science and artificial intelligence.
                        He played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma
                        code during World War II, which significantly
                        contributed to the Allied victory.

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale,
                    London. He studied mathematics at King's College, Cambridge,
                    and later at Princeton University. Turing's work laid the
                    foundations for modern computing and he is best known for
                    the Turing machine concept, which is a fundamental model of
                    computation.

                <p>
                    During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, where
                    he developed techniques to break the Enigma code used by the
                    German military. His efforts are estimated to have shortened
                    the war by several years and saved countless lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tragically, Turing's life ended prematurely when he died on
                    June 7, 1954. In 2013, he was posthumously pardoned by Queen
                    Elizabeth II for his conviction of "gross indecency" due to
                    his homosexuality, which was illegal in the UK at the time.
