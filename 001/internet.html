            <p>
                A global network of computers connected to each other that
                allows for communication through a standardized set of
                protocols.

            <p>
                The internet is not controlled by a person or entity. The
                internet is composed of many independently operated networks.
                While originally for resilient communication (ARPANET), the
                internet has evolved so that information can be shared with
                anyone. What may seem unimportant to you might be valuable to
                someone else.

            <h2>Information Flow</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to how a postal service send packages from one location
                to another, the internet allows for the information to flow from
                one computer to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                The information in the internet is in encoded in what we call
                bits, which are a binary representation of opposites like 1s and
                0s. Every piece of data sent over the Internet, whether it's a
                message, image, or video, is first converted into bits. These
                bits are grouped into
                <strong>bytes</strong>, with one byte consisting of 8 bits.
                Bytes are the standard unit for measuring digital information in
                computing.
            </p>
            <h3>Units of Digital Information</h3>
            <p>
                As data increases in size, we use larger units to measure it.
                Below are some common units of digital information:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Unit</th>
                    <th>Equals</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1 Bit</td>
                    <td>1 Bit</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

            <h2>Physical Communication</h2>
            <p>
                In today's world, the bits can be sent through various physical
                mediums, such as electricity, light, and radio waves.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                One problem with using physical mediums such as electricity and
                light is that how do we communicate several 1s or 0s in a row? A
                solution is to use a timer to determine how long the electricity
                or light is on or off.
            </p>
            <h3>Measure of Speed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bandwidth</strong> is the maximum amount of
                    transmission capacity of a communication medium. It is
                    typically measured in bit rates, which is the number of bits
                    that can be transmitted per second.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Latency</strong> is the measure of the time it takes
                    for a bit to travel from one point to another. It is
                    typically measured in milliseconds (ms).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <table>
